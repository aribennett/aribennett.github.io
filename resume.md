<br>

### The Hillman Group
#### Technology Director <span>2021 to present</span> 
* Directed a team of engineers doing research and development on a next generation home and auto key kiosk 
* Invented computational strategies for inverse kinematics, toolpathing, computer vision and path planning
#### Resharp Technology Director <span>2019 to 2021</span> 
* Developed a Linux platform deployed on 2000 kiosks nationwide
* Led a multidisciplinary team integrating the Resharp product into the existing MinuteKEY management and observability platform, eliminating the need for dedicated Resharp customer service and support staff
* Designed and built out services managing communications, robotic controls, software deployment, firmware deployment, user interaction, observability and analytics on hundreds of deployed kiosks
* Architected and implemented tools, data model and underlying architecture for operating a distributed fleet of machines to enable continuous improvement and reduced the on call load to near zero
* Created motor commutation and feedback control systems to reduce cost and improve reliability and obeservability of embedded systems, allowing remote troubleshooting and history analysis of hardware issues
### Resharp 
#### Cofounder and CTO  <span>2017 to 2019 (acquired by the Hillman Group)</span>
* Led initial mechanical, electronic, and software prototyping and development for an automated knife sharpening kiosk deployed as a "hardware as a service" product (resharp.com)
* Grew the team and managed the execution of all three disciplines, leading integration and top level design
* Ran reliability testing to validate full stack design and built the tests and observability tools required to close the loop and extend kiosk life
### Stanford Product Realization Lab
#### Teaching Assistant <span>2015 to 2017</span>
* Coached introductory and advanced design courses at the Stanford Product Realization Lab as a teaching assistant. Instructed over 500 students how to execute their projects and how to approach ideas from the standpoint of feasibility, value and aesthetic
* Ran operations, training and safety oversight in the Product Realization Lab Machine shop
* Taught graduate coursework in computational 3D printing design
### Boosted Boards 
#### Mechatronics Intern <span>2015</span>  
* Designed an electric skateboard controller and managed user testing and DFM
### KIWI GMBH
#### Mechanical Engineering and Product Design Intern <span>2014</span> 
* Owned and developed the ID, user testing and DFM for a consumer keyless entry solution
