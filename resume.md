### The Hillman Group
#### <i> Senior Director of Software Engineering </i> <span>2022 to Present</span> 
* Managed several teams comprised of 20 engineers developing multiple next generation consumer kiosks
* Architected the implementation of machine learning computer vision systems, while personally developing the required heuristic vision algorithms
* Invented computational strategies for inverse kinematics, toolpathing, computer vision and path planning
* Managed the innovation and IP strategy and its implementation within the new product development process
* Oversaw the development and deployment of full stack software to a multinational fleet of over 17,000 kiosks
* Created long term strategies for expanding SAAS opportunities for fleet management
#### <i> Technology Director </i> <span>2019 to 2022</span> 
* Developed a Linux platform tailored for kiosk applications deployed in 2000 stores nationwide
* Led a multidisciplinary team integrating the Resharp product into the existing MinuteKEY management and observability platform, eliminating the need for dedicated Resharp customer service and support staff
* Designed and built out services managing communications, robotic controls, software deployment, firmware deployment, user interaction, observability and analytics on hundreds of deployed kiosks
* Created AI streaming solutions to provide prognostics from field data, allowing for extremely efficient issue diagnosis and alerting
* Architected and implemented tools, data model and underlying architecture for operating a distributed fleet of machines to enable continuous improvement and reduce the on-call load to near zero
### Resharp 
#### <i> Cofounder and CTO </i> <span>2017 to 2019 (acquired by the Hillman Group)</span>
* Led software, electrical, and mechanical prototyping and development for an automated knife sharpening kiosk deployed as a "hardware as a service" product (resharp.com)
* Built an end to end fleet management platform on top of AWS IOT for managing software deploys, observability, analytics, and more
* Grew the team from founders to 6 people and managed the execution of all engineering tasks
* Ran reliability testing to validate kiosk design and built tests and observability tools required to extend kiosk life
### Stanford Product Realization Lab
#### <i> Teaching Assistant </i> <span>2015 to 2017</span>
* Coached introductory and advanced mechanical and product design courses at the Stanford Product Realization Lab as a teaching assistant. Instructed over 500 students how to execute their projects and how to approach ideas from the standpoint of feasibility, value and aesthetic
* Taught graduate coursework in computational 3D printing design
### Boosted Boards 
#### <i> Mechatronics Intern </i> <span>2015</span>  
* Designed an electric skateboard controller and managed user testing and DFM
