## Software
Developed a linux platform used for a kiosk put into nationwide service, building out services managing communications, robotic controls, software deployment, firmware deployment, user interaction, observability and analytics. Created tools and underlying architecture for operation of a distributed fleet of machines, and well as the data model to enable continuous improvement to better anticipate customer needs and perform fleetwide prognostics. Integrated numerous other software systems as part of an aquisition, and lead architecture development for a nationally scaled product fleet with a team of engineers. Was responsible for every part of the tech stack, from services in the cloud handling analytics and observability, to implementation and deployment of embedded firmware in the field.
## Mechatronics
Developed numerous controls systems for various projects, including motor commutation, feedback control, inverse kinematics, toolpathing, computer vision and path planning. Did initial mechanical, electronical, and software prototyping and development before growing the team and taking over managing the technical requirements and execution of all three disciplines. Ran reliability testing to validate full stack design and built the tests and observability tools required to close the loop and refine products.
## Design
Did novel invention and iteration for multiple robotic products, taking them through all product phases from prototype to scaled manufacturing. Coached introductory and advanced design courses at the Stanford Product Realization Lab as a teaching assistant. Instructed over 500 students how to execute their projects and how to approach ideas from the standpoint of feasibility, value and aesthetic.
