Interdisciplinary engineer with experience in software, mechatronics, and design. Experience taking mechatronic products from initial prototype to scaled manufacturing and operation.

### The Hillman Group, Technology Director, 2019 to present  
* Developed a Linux platform used for a kiosk put into nationwide service
* Led architecture development and integration for a nationally scaled product fleet with a team of engineers as part of the acquisition
* Built out services managing communications, robotic controls, software deployment, firmware deployment, user interaction, observability and analytics
* Created tools, data model and underlying architecture for the operation of a distributed fleet of machines to enable continuous improvement, anticipate customer needs and perform fleetwide prognostics and diagnostics
* Designed motor commutation and feedback control systems for multiple products to reduce cost and improve reliability.
* Implemented computational strategies for inverse kinematics, toolpathing, computer vision and path planning
* Spearheaded research and development for new product initiatives
### Resharp, Co-Founder and CTO, 2017 to 2019 (acquired 2019)
* Led initial mechanical, electronic, and software prototyping and development before growing the team and taking over managing the technical requirements and execution of all three disciplines
* Ran reliability testing to validate full stack design and built the tests and observability tools required to close the loop and refine products
### Stanford Product Realization Lab Teaching Assistant, 2015-2017  
* Coached introductory and advanced design courses at the Stanford Product Realization Lab as a teaching assistant. Instructed over 500 students how to execute their projects and how to approach ideas from the standpoint of feasibility, value and aesthetic
* Ran operations, training and safety of the Product Realization Lab Machine shop
* Taught graduate coursework in computational 3D printing design
### Boosted Boards, Mechatronics Intern, 2015  
* Designed an electric skateboard controller and managed user testing and DFM
### KIWI GMBH, Mechanical Engineering and Product Design Intern, 2014 
* Owned and developed the ID, user testing and DFM for a consumer keyless entry solution
